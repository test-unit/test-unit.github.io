    <p>= Test::Unit - Ruby Unit Testing Framework</p>

<p>== Introduction</p>

<p>Unit testing is making waves all over the place, largely due to the
fact that it is a core practice of XP. While XP is great, unit testing
has been around for a long time and has always been a good idea. One
of the keys to good unit testing, though, is not just writing tests,
but having tests. What’s the difference? Well, if you just <em>write</em> a
test and throw it away, you have no guarantee that something won’t
change later which breaks your code. If, on the other hand, you <em>have</em>
tests (obviously you have to write them first), and run them as often
as possible, you slowly build up a wall of things that cannot break
without you immediately knowing about it. This is when unit testing
hits its peak usefulness.</p>

<p>Enter Test::Unit, a framework for unit testing in Ruby, helping you to
design, debug and evaluate your code by making it easy to write and
have tests for it.</p>

<p>== Notes</p>

<p>Test::Unit has grown out of and superceded Lapidary.</p>

<p>== Feedback</p>

<p>I like (and do my best to practice) XP, so I value early releases,
user feedback, and clean, simple, expressive code. There is always
room for improvement in everything I do, and Test::Unit is no
exception. Please, let me know what you think of Test::Unit as it
stands, and what you’d like to see expanded/changed/improved/etc. If
you find a bug, let me know ASAP; one good way to let me know what the
bug is is to submit a new test that catches it :-) Also, I’d love to
hear about any successes you have with Test::Unit, and any
documentation you might add will be greatly appreciated. My contact
info is below.</p>

<p>== Contact Information</p>

<p>A lot of discussion happens about Ruby in general on the ruby-talk
mailing list (http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/ml.html), and you can ask
any questions you might have there. I monitor the list, as do many
other helpful Rubyists, and you’re sure to get a quick answer. Of
course, you’re also welcome to email me (Nathaniel Talbott) directly
at mailto:testunit@talbott.ws, and I’ll do my best to help you out.</p>

<p>== Credits</p>

<p>I’d like to thank…</p>

<p>Matz, for a great language!</p>

<p>Masaki Suketa, for his work on RubyUnit, which filled a vital need in
the Ruby world for a very long time. I’m also grateful for his help in
polishing Test::Unit and getting the RubyUnit compatibility layer
right. His graciousness in allowing Test::Unit to supercede RubyUnit
continues to be a challenge to me to be more willing to defer my own
rights.</p>

<p>Ken McKinlay, for his interest and work on unit testing, and for his
willingness to dialog about it. He was also a great help in pointing
out some of the holes in the RubyUnit compatibility layer.</p>

<p>Dave Thomas, for the original idea that led to the extremely simple
“require ‘test/unit’”, plus his code to improve it even more by
allowing the selection of tests from the command-line. Also, without
RDoc, the documentation for Test::Unit would stink a lot more than it
does now.</p>

<p>Everyone who’s helped out with bug reports, feature ideas,
encouragement to continue, etc. It’s a real privilege to be a part of
the Ruby community.</p>

<p>The guys at RoleModel Software, for putting up with me repeating, “But
this would be so much easier in Ruby!” whenever we’re coding in Java.</p>

<p>My Creator, for giving me life, and giving it more abundantly.</p>

<p>= Usage</p>

<p>The general idea behind unit testing is that you write a <em>test</em>
<em>method</em> that makes certain <em>assertions</em> about your code, working
against a <em>test</em> <em>fixture</em>. A bunch of these <em>test</em> <em>methods</em> are
bundled up into a <em>test</em> <em>suite</em> and can be run any time the
developer wants. The results of a run are gathered in a <em>test</em>
<em>result</em> and displayed to the user through some UI. So, lets break
this down and see how Test::Unit provides each of these necessary
pieces.</p>

<p>== Assertions</p>

<p>These are the heart of the framework. Think of an assertion as a
statement of expected outcome, i.e. “I assert that x should be equal
to y”. If, when the assertion is executed, it turns out to be
correct, nothing happens, and life is good. If, on the other hand,
your assertion turns out to be false, an error is propagated with
pertinent information so that you can go back and make your
assertion succeed, and, once again, life is good. For an explanation
of the current assertions, see Test::Unit::Assertions.</p>

<p>== Test Method &amp; Test Fixture</p>

<p>Obviously, these assertions have to be called within a context that
knows about them and can do something meaningful with their
pass/fail value. Also, it’s handy to collect a bunch of related
tests, each test represented by a method, into a common test class
that knows how to run them. The tests will be in a separate class
from the code they’re testing for a couple of reasons. First of all,
it allows your code to stay uncluttered with test code, making it
easier to maintain. Second, it allows the tests to be stripped out
for deployment, since they’re really there for you, the developer,
and your users don’t need them. Third, and most importantly, it
allows you to set up a common test fixture for your tests to run
against.</p>

<p>What’s a test fixture? Well, tests do not live in a vacuum; rather,
they’re run against the code they are testing. Often, a collection
of tests will run against a common set of data, also called a
fixture. If they’re all bundled into the same test class, they can
all share the setting up and tearing down of that data, eliminating
unnecessary duplication and making it much easier to add related
tests.</p>

<p>Test::Unit::TestCase wraps up a collection of test methods together
and allows you to easily set up and tear down the same test fixture
for each test. This is done by overriding #setup and/or #teardown,
which will be called before and after each test method that is
run. The TestCase also knows how to collect the results of your
assertions into a Test::Unit::TestResult, which can then be reported
back to you… but I’m getting ahead of myself. To write a test,
follow these steps:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Make sure Test::Unit is in your library path.</li>
  <li>require ‘test/unit’ in your test script.</li>
  <li>Create a class that subclasses Test::Unit::TestCase.</li>
  <li>Add a method that begins with “test” to your class.</li>
  <li>Make assertions in your test method.</li>
  <li>Optionally define #setup and/or #teardown to set up and/or tear
down your common test fixture.</li>
  <li>You can now run your test as you would any other Ruby
script… try it and see!</li>
</ul>

<p>A really simple test might look like this (#setup and #teardown are
commented out to indicate that they are completely optional):</p>

<pre class="code ruby"><code class="ruby"><span class='id identifier rubyid_require'>require</span> <span class='tstring'><span class='tstring_beg'>&#39;</span><span class='tstring_content'>test/unit</span><span class='tstring_end'>&#39;</span></span>

<span class='kw'>class</span> <span class='const'>MyTest</span> <span class='op'>&lt;</span> <span class='const'>Test</span><span class='op'>::</span><span class='const'>Unit</span><span class='op'>::</span><span class='const'>TestCase</span>
  <span class='comment'># def setup
</span>  <span class='comment'># end
</span>
  <span class='comment'># def teardown
</span>  <span class='comment'># end
</span>
  <span class='kw'>def</span> <span class='id identifier rubyid_test_fail'>test_fail</span>
    <span class='id identifier rubyid_assert'>assert</span><span class='lparen'>(</span><span class='kw'>false</span><span class='comma'>,</span> <span class='tstring'><span class='tstring_beg'>&#39;</span><span class='tstring_content'>Assertion was false.</span><span class='tstring_end'>&#39;</span></span><span class='rparen'>)</span>
  <span class='kw'>end</span>
<span class='kw'>end</span>
</code></pre>

<p>== Test Runners</p>

<p>So, now you have this great test class, but you still
need a way to run it and view any failures that occur
during the run. There are some test runner; console test
runner, GTK+ test runner and so on. The console test
runner is automatically invoked for you if you require
‘test/unit’ and simply run the file. To use another
runner simply set default test runner ID to
Test::Unit::AutoRunner:</p>

<p>require ‘test/unit’
   Test::Unit::AutoRunner.default_runner = “gtk2”</p>

<p>== Test Suite</p>

<p>As more and more unit tests accumulate for a given project, it
becomes a real drag running them one at a time, and it also
introduces the potential to overlook a failing test because you
forget to run it. Suddenly it becomes very handy that the
TestRunners can take any object that returns a Test::Unit::TestSuite
in response to a suite method. The TestSuite can, in turn, contain
other TestSuites or individual tests (typically created by a
TestCase). In other words, you can easily wrap up a group of
TestCases and TestSuites.</p>

<p>Test::Unit does a little bit more for you, by wrapping
these up automatically when you require
‘test/unit’. What does this mean? It means you could
write the above test case like this instead:</p>

<p>require ‘test/unit’
 require ‘test_myfirsttests’
 require ‘test_moretestsbyme’
 require ‘test_anothersetoftests’</p>

<p>Test::Unit is smart enough to find all the test cases existing in
the ObjectSpace and wrap them up into a suite for you. It then runs
the dynamic suite using the console TestRunner.</p>

<p>== Configuration file</p>

<p>Test::Unitは現在のワーキングディレクトリにある’test-unit.yml’をTest::Unitの設定ファイルとして読み込みます。このファイルには以下のような設定をすることができます。</p>

<ul>
  <li>color scheme definitions</li>
  <li>test runner to be used</li>
  <li>test runner options</li>
  <li>test collector to be used</li>
</ul>

<p>カラースキーム定義以外はコマンドラインオプションで指定することができます。</p>

<p>以下はカラースキームの定義例です。</p>

<p>color_schemes:
    inverted:
      success:
        name: red
        bold: true
      failure:
        name: green
        bold: true
    other_scheme:
      …</p>

<p>Here are the syntax of color scheme definitions:</p>

<p>color_schemes:
   SCHEME_NAME:
     EVENT_NAME:
       name: COLOR_NAME
       intensity: BOOLEAN
       bold: BOOLEAN
       italic: BOOLEAN
       underline: BOOLEAN
     …
   …</p>

<p>SCHEME_NAME:: the name of the color scheme
EVENT_NAME:: one of [success, failure, pending,
             omission, notification, error]
COLOR_NAME:: one of [black, red, green, yellow, blue,
             magenta, cyan, white]
BOOLEAN:: true or false</p>

<p>上で定義した’inverted’カラースキムを使う設定は以下の通りです。</p>

<p>runner: console
  console_options:
    color_scheme: inverted
  color_schemes:
    inverted:
      success:
        name: red
        bold: true
      failure:
        name: green
        bold: true</p>

<p>== Questions?</p>

<p>I’d really like to get feedback from all levels of Ruby
practitioners about typos, grammatical errors, unclear statements,
missing points, etc., in this document (or any other).</p>
